🌩️ Google Cloud Training Summarizations

Welcome to my repository of Google Cloud Labs Summaries — a curated collection of concise, structured write-ups from hands-on labs across networking, compute, AI/ML, and data engineering tracks.

The goal of this repo is to provide:

🗂️ Organized lab notes for quick review

🧩 Digestible templates that highlight objectives, tools, and workflows

🚀 Key takeaways & real-world applications for cloud projects

🧠 Reflections to reinforce learning and track progress

📚 Lab Categories
☁️ Core Cloud Fundamentals

Google Cloud Marketplace (LAMP Stack Deployment)
Learned how to quickly deploy a full web stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) using Marketplace.

Networking Fundamentals (VPC)
Explored Virtual Private Clouds, subnets, and firewall rules for secure network design.

Hello Cloud Run
Deployed a containerized application with Cloud Run for serverless scaling.

🧠 AI & Machine Learning Labs

AI/ML Fundamentals with Google Cloud
Built and deployed ML models, explored Vertex AI workflows, and learned how cloud infrastructure supports data-driven intelligence.

📊 Data Engineering & Analytics

Cloud SQL: Importing & Analyzing NYC Taxi Trips
Imported CSVs into Cloud SQL, validated data integrity, and performed SQL analysis on taxi trip records.

BigQuery: Bike & Weather Analysis
Joined NYC bike rentals with NOAA weather data to uncover correlations between rain and bike usage.

BigQuery: Loading & Querying Data
Learned data ingestion from CSVs, Google Cloud Storage, and table creation with DDL.

BigQuery: Working with Semi-Structured Data (Arrays & Structs)
Queried and un-nested JSON, arrays, and structs for deeper analysis of complex schemas.

BigQuery: Partitioned Tables
Optimized queries with date-based partitioning and auto-expiring partitions for cost savings and compliance.

🏆 Key Takeaways

Cloud Fundamentals: Marketplace enables rapid deployment of complete stacks with minimal configuration.

Networking: VPCs and firewall rules are the foundation of secure and scalable infrastructure.

Serverless: Cloud Run abstracts infrastructure while supporting container-based workloads.

Data Engineering: Data integrity checks are crucial before building pipelines.

BigQuery: Combining partitioning, arrays, structs, and public datasets unlocks real-world analytics at scale.

AI/ML: Vertex AI and cloud ML pipelines simplify deploying data science projects in production.
